# Simple OPA Integration Project

## üîç Project Overview

This Python project is a **proof of concept** demonstrating the integration of [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) for **authorization of a REST API**. 

## ‚ú® Features

* üì¶ Python 3.11 with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency and virtualenv management
* üßπ Code Quality:
  * [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for formatting, linting, and import sorting
  * [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) for Dockerfile linting
  * [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking
* ‚úÖ Testing: [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) with coverage reporting
* üõ†Ô∏è Task Automation: `Makefile` with useful development commands
* üê≥ Docker support
* üîê Open Policy Agent (OPA) integration for dynamic API authorization

## API, Middleware and OPA Integration

### üîê Authentication Middleware

This project uses a custom **authentication middleware** that extracts the user role from the incoming HTTP request headers and delegates access control decisions to the `AuthorizationService`.

#### üìå Header-Based Role Identification

The middleware expects a custom HTTP header `x-role` to identify the user's role (e.g., `admin`, `user`, `guest`).

If the header is **missing**, it **defaults to `guest`**, which typically has **no access rights**, following the **Principle of Least Privilege** ‚Äî users are granted only the minimum access necessary. As a result, such requests are rejected unless explicitly permitted for the `guest` role.

* `x-role`: Custom header used to indicate the user's role
* Defaults to `guest` if missing
* Uses `AuthorizationService` to verify access
* Rejects requests that are not authorized for the role

### ‚úÖ Example Request

```http
GET /users HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
x-role: admin
```

If `x-role` is omitted:

```http
GET /users HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
```

### üë§ UserController ‚Äì API Overview

The `UserController` defines a simple CRUD interface for user management. It is responsible for handling the following endpoints:

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint      | Description             | Role Check    |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------------- |---------------|
| GET    | `/users`      | Fetch all users         | Admin         |
| POST   | `/users`      | Create a new user       | Admin         |
| PUT    | `/users/<id>` | Update an existing user | Admin or User |
| DELETE | `/users/<id>` | Delete a user           | Admin         |

All endpoints in the `UserController` are protected by **OPA policies**. Each request is authorized using a custom Sanic middleware that queries the OPA engine to evaluate access based on:

* `x-role` header from the request
* HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
* Endpoint path (`request.path`)

### OPA Integration

![OPA](docs/opa_deployment.png)

Rego policy for `GET` endpoint:

```rego
package simple.authz

default allow = false

allow {
    input.role == "admin"
}

allow if {
    input.method == "GET"
    input.path = ["api", "v1", "users", user_id]
    is_valid_uuid(user_id)
    input.user.role in {"admin", "viewer"}
}

```

Figure 2 illustrates a API call to OPA using Postman

![Execution](docs/postman.png)

Example using Curl
```
	@curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8181/v1/data/simple/authz/allow \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"input": {"method": "GET", "path": ["api", "v1", "users", "b71207a4-ddac-493c-857d-f6d116289505"], "user": {"role": "viewer"}}}'
```
