# Simple OPA Integration Project

This Python project is a **proof of concept** demonstrating the integration of [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) for **authorization of a REST API**. 

The poc include following approaches of loading `Policies`
1.  Local File System.
2.  Loading from a Remote service( in poc a Python web service is started to serve the Policy).
3.  Loading from AWS S3 bucket (The security is controlled by POD's IAM rules in actual Prod deployment)

## API, Middleware and OPA Integration

The middleware uses the `Authorization` HTTP header to extract a **JWT token**. This token contains the user's role, which is verified and decoded securely using OPA.

1. `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>` is passed with the request
2. Middleware forwards the token, method, and path to OPA
3. OPA decodes and verifies the token
4. Access is allowed or denied based on decoded role

```http
GET /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### üë§ UserController ‚Äì API Overview

The `UserController` defines a simple CRUD interface for user management. It is responsible for handling the following endpoints:

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint      | Description             | Role Check    |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------------- |---------------|
| GET    | `/users`      | Fetch all users         | Admin         |
| POST   | `/users`      | Create a new user       | Admin         |
| PUT    | `/users/<id>` | Update an existing user | Admin or User |
| DELETE | `/users/<id>` | Delete a user           | Admin         |

All endpoints in the `UserController` are protected by **OPA policies**. Each request is authorized using a custom Sanic middleware that queries the OPA engine to evaluate access based on:

* `x-role` header from the request
* HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
* Endpoint path (`request.path`)

### OPA Integration

This project supports **three modes** for running the Open Policy Agent (OPA) Authorization Service:

The policies are split into reusable packages:

* `common.jwt_utils`: Responsible for decoding and verifying JWTs
* `simple.authz`: Implements authorization rules using decoded claims

```
deployment/authz/policies/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common/   #  Helper methods used by the policy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ authz/    # Application route Authorization Policies  
```


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Local Policy Mount (authz-v1)

In this mode, the OPA container is started with policies mounted directly from the local filesystem.

**Docker Compose Service:**

```yaml
authz-service-v1:
  profiles: ["authz-v1"]
  image: openpolicyagent/opa:latest
  command: ["run", "--server", "--addr", "0.0.0.0:8181", "/policies"]
  volumes:
    - $PWD/deployment/authz/policies:/policies
```

**Start Command:**

```bash
make AUTHZ_PROFILE=authz-v1 authz_start
```

OPA will **immediately load and serve policies** found under `deployment/authz/policies`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Remote Bundle Server (authz-v2)

In this mode, OPA loads its policies from a **remote bundle server** via a config file.

**Docker Compose Services:**

* `bundle-server`: Serves policy bundles from `deployment/authz/dist`
* `authz-service-v2`: Fetches and loads policies via `authz_config.yaml`

**OPA Config File:** `deployment/authz/config/authz_config.yaml`

```yaml
services:
  - name: bundle-server
    url: http://bundle-server:8888
bundles:
  authz:
    service: bundle-server
    resource: /bundle.tar.gz
    polling:
      min_delay_seconds: 300
      max_delay_seconds: 600
```

**Start Command:**

```bash
make AUTHZ_PROFILE=authz-v2 authz_start
```

OPA will **fetch `bundle.tar.gz`** from the bundle server and load policies dynamically.

### üîÅ Switching Between Modes

Use the `AUTHZ_PROFILE` Makefile variable to switch between the two modes:

```bash
# Local policy mount
make AUTHZ_PROFILE=authz-v1 start

# Remote bundle via server
make AUTHZ_PROFILE=authz-v2 start
```


![OPA](docs/opa_deployment.png)

Rego policy for `GET` endpoint:

```rego
package simple.authz
import data.common.utils.is_valid_uuid
import data.common.utils.jwt.decode_token

default allow = false

allow if {
    claims := decode_token(input.token)
    claims.role in {"admin", "viewer"}
    input.method == "GET"
    input.path = ["api", "v1", "users", user_id]
    is_valid_uuid(user_id)
}

```
